            <h3>No: 1</h3>
            <h4>Difference between Var, Let, Const</h4>
            <p>A lot of shiny new features came out with ES2015 (ES6). And now, since it's 2020, it's assumed that a lot of JavaScript developers have become familiar with and have started using these features.</p>
            <p>One of the features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and const, which can be used for variable declaration. The question is, what makes them different from good ol' var which we've been using? If you are still not clear about this, then this article is for you.</p>
            <h4>Var:</h4>
            <p>Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge. First, let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues.</p>
            <h4>Scope of Var:</h4>
            <p>Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped. <br> The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window. <br> var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.</p>

            <h4>Let:</h4>
            <p>let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.</p>
            <h4>Let is blocked scope</h4>
            <p>A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.So a variable declared in a block with let  is only available for use within that block. </p>
            <h4>let can be updated but not re-declared.</h4>
            <p>Just like var,  a variable declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var, a let variable cannot be re-declared within its scope.</p>

            <h4>Const:</h4>
            <p>Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.</p>
            <h4>const declarations are block scoped</h4>
            <p>Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.</p>
            <h4>const cannot be updated or re-declared</h4>
            <p>This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared.</p>

            <h4>The Difference Between Regular Functions and Arrow Functions</h4>
            <h4>Arrow Function</h4>
            <p>Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences between them.</p>
            <p>The arrow function example above allows a developer to accomplish the same result with fewer lines of code and approximately half the typing.Curly brackets are not required if only one expression is present.</p>
            <p>Arrow functions do not have an arguments binding. However, they have access to the arguments object of the closest non-arrow parent function. Named and rest parameters are heavily relied upon to capture the arguments passed to arrow functions.</p>
            <h4>Regular Function</h4>
            <p>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword.

                However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword.</p>
